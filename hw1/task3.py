class Card:
    """
    A class for representing cards in the Compatibility card game.

    In this game, each card has a set of features, where both the
    feature's name and value are strings. For example,
    a card could have three features: color, shape, and number.
    The values for these features could be "red", "circle", and "3",
    respectively.
    """

    def __init__(self, features):

        Constructor. Initializes the card with the provided features.

        Once the features for a card are set, the values of the features
        can be changed, but the features themselves cannot be changed

        In other words, if we initialize the "color" feature to "red", we can
        change its value to "blue" later on. However, we cannot rename the
        feature to "colour" or add new features.
